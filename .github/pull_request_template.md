### PR Labels 🏷️
You can trigger CI/CD actions by adding labels on this PR:

- `infracost` will run the Infracost FinOps tool on any IaC repository
- `tested` will merge this PR if the minumum number of approvals is added, all workflows/tests have passed and conversations resolved
- `trivy` will run the Trivy vulnerability scanning tool, highlighting, hopefully not at all, security issues :D
- `wip` will block the PR from being merged to main/master, as the changes are still WIP

**NOTE:** If the PR has the `wip` and `tested` label on the PR, the PR will not be able to merge into the master/main branch.
